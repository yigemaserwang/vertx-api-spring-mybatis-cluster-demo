传统ssm模式，采用vertx直接改造，适用分布式集群扩展，适用于单机应用，应对于流量激增和分布式扩展，从一台服务器，扩展成集群

This project shows how you can setup a clustered Vert.x embedded in Spring Boot, having the Spring container managing Hazelcast.

and you can easy change  old ssm pattern (spring springmvc mybatis) to suit it.


== The application.properties

The host should be set the machine address which runing server, that can be used when servers run different machine.

host=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx


== Trying

To see clustering in action, you should start multiple instances of this application.
The HTTP server will be setup only if you provide an `httpPort` system property.

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package
----


So you can start the first instance with an HTTP server on port 8080:


[source,shell]
----
mvn spring-boot:run -DhttpPort=8080
----

Then start the other instances without the HTTP server:

[source,shell]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

And then start the other instances the other without the HTTP server:

[source,shell]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

It's time for testing now:

[source,shell]
----
seq 10 | while read i; do curl http://localhost:8080/article/findAll; echo; done
----
----
seq 10 | while read i; do curl -d  "fld_title=mytitle${i}&fld_content=mycontent${i}" "http://localhost:8080/article/add"; echo; done
----
